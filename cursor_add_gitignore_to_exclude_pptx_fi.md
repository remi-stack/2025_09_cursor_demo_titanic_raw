add a gitignore file to avoid sending .pptx files to github

I'll help you create a `.gitignore` file to prevent `.pptx` files from being tracked by Git and sent to GitHub.

Let me first check the current directory structure to see where to place the `.gitignore` file:


I can see this is a Git repository (there's a `.git/` directory). I'll create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory to exclude `.pptx` files from being tracked:


```ignore
# PowerPoint files
*.pptx

# Other common files to ignore
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
*.log
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.env
.venv/
venv/
```

Perfect! I've created a `.gitignore` file in your repository root that will:

1. **Exclude all `.pptx` files** - This prevents PowerPoint files from being tracked by Git
2. **Include other common exclusions** - I've also added some standard files that are typically ignored in Python projects (like `__pycache__/`, `.pyc` files, virtual environments, etc.)

The `.gitignore` file is now in place and will prevent any `.pptx` files from being accidentally committed to your repository. If you already have `.pptx` files that are currently tracked by Git, you may need to remove them from tracking first using:

```bash
git rm --cached *.pptx
```

This will remove them from Git tracking while keeping the files on your local system.

```shellscript
git rm --cached *.pptx
```
